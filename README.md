# Tiny C Projects

> Repository based on Dan Gookin's Tiny C Projects

So far, the code in this repo is one to one replica of code from Dan's book. However, I plan to add more along the way.

This repository is not for serious purposes! I like programming and am working on my C language skills. To kill some time, doing things worthwhile, I read books, these days, Iâ€™m delving into Tiny C Projects and there's no point in just staring at the code-snippets, so I thought Iâ€™d type them out. I might just learn a few things here n there.

## TCP 1: Greeting.c

This is a small C program that ("when run" **stating the obvious** ğŸ˜…) outputs a greeting for the user. The purpose is to add this program in bash shell's startup file `.bashrc` (**like you already didn't know that!**), so that whenever a new user logs in, they are greeted with a pleasant message.

> There lies a moon phase algorithm in this T-C-P, and unlike Dan, I did look into it (GPT **coughs** ğŸ¤«), as a result I understand it somewhat better, however for all intents and purposes it's still just a toy!
